## 🌍 Problem Statement

**263 million children worldwide lack access to quality education.** Many live in low-connectivity regions where traditional online educational tools fail. Teachers often lack resources and training, while students struggle with content that doesn't reflect their cultural context or practical needs.

OfflineLearn bridges this gap by providing an **AI-powered educational assistant that works entirely offline**, adapts to local cultures, and requires minimal resources.

## ✨ What Makes OfflineLearn Different

### 🔄 **Adaptive Learning Engine**
- Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on student performance

- Learns from student interaction patterns to improve over time

### 🌏 **Cultural Context Awareness**
- Automatically adapts content to local contexts (farming, markets, local currencies)
- Uses familiar examples and culturally relevant scenarios
- Respects local educational traditions and knowledge systems

### 🎯 **Socratic Teaching Method**
- Guides students through discovery rather than giving direct answers
- Builds critical thinking skills through strategic questioning
- Encourages student confidence and independent problem-solving

### 📶 **Offline-First Design**
- Works completely without internet connection

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### For Students

**Getting Help with Math:**
```
Student: "I don't understand how to solve 2x + 5 = 13"

OfflineLearn: "I can see you're working with an equation! Let me ask you this: 
What do you think our goal is when we have an equation like this? What are we 
trying to find?"

[Guides student through Socratic questioning to discover the solution]
```

**Practice Problems:**
```
Request: "Generate 3 fraction problems for grade 6 students in rural Kenya"

OfflineLearn: Creates problems about:
